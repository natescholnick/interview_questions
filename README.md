## Welcome, friend

This is an ongoing collection of work on coding problems and, with any luck, their solutions too.

If you solve any problems individually and want to add them here, just put them in a folder with your own name. No spoilers!

Commit format: `Problem source: problem name` As an example:
```
leetcode2: Add Two Numbers
```
